Parse the command line arguments. 
You should have four arguments: 
the input file, the first command, 
the second command, and the output file.

Create a pipe using the pipe() function. 
This will give you two file descriptors: 
one for reading from the pipe, 
and one for writing to it.

Fork the process using the fork() function. 
This will create a child process that is 
a duplicate of the current process.

In the child process (where fork() returns 0),
you will want to execute the first command. 
Before doing this, you should redirect the 
standard output to the write end of the pipe 
using the dup2() function. Then, you can execute 
the command using the execve() function.

In the parent process (where fork() returns 
the PID of the child process), 
you will want to execute the second command. 
Before doing this, you should redirect 
the standard input to the read end of the pipe. 
hen, you can execute the command.

Finally, you should wait for both child 
processes to finish using the waitpid() function.
